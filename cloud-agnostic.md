# Cloud agnostic

## Overview

Cloud agnostic is the ability that app can be operated on any cloud platforms without depending on specific feature of those platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...).

This can help system can be migrated easily between cloud platforms without affecting the overview architecture of the system.

## Basic features

- `Interoperability`: seamless operation between cloud platforms.
- `Portability`: easy to migrate, deploy between cloud platforms.
- `Independence`: independing on any API or services.
- `Flexibility`: easy to choose cloud provider that adapts the system requirements.

To archive `cloud-agnostic` most systems use:

- Docker for containerize.
- Kubernetes for orchestrating.
